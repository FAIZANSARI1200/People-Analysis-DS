👥 People Analysis using Python
This project focuses on analyzing individuals based on their years of experience and number of completed projects to derive insights such as performance grouping and role suitability. The analysis was carried out as part of an internship at Paarsh Infotech.

🧠 Objective
To perform data-driven people analysis by:

Categorizing individuals based on their experience and project involvement.

Identifying patterns such as high-performing groups, outliers, and experience gaps.

Assisting HR or management in talent segmentation and resource planning.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Python

Pandas – data manipulation

Matplotlib / Seaborn – data visualization

Jupyter Notebook – interactive development

CSV / Excel – input data format

📁 Features
✔️ Data cleaning and null-value handling

✔️ Categorization by experience level (e.g., Beginner, Intermediate, Expert)

✔️ Grouping based on number of projects

✔️ Visualizations like bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots

✔️ Insights on correlations between experience and number of projects

🧪 Sample Insights
📊 Most contributors fall under the 2–5 years of experience range.

🚀 Individuals with >5 projects often have more than 3 years of experience.

🔍 Identified a cluster of high-contributors with relatively low experience (fast learners or high performers).

🚀 How to Use
Clone this repository

Open people_analysis.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook

Replace people_data.csv with your dataset (if needed)
